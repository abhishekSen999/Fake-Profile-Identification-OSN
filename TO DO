*validate number of clusters using agglomerative - when we are applying HAC dendogram is clearly shows 2 clusters
*unsupervised learning to validate class labels using k means
*hypertuning of kNN and ANN
*make table for ANN - activation function,no of hidden layers,number of units in each hidden layer
*to apply and evaluate 6 supervised learning algorithms
*-naive bayes
*-rochio
*-SVM
*-Decision Tree - kfold for overfitting problem
*-KNN
*-ANN
*accuracy, recall , percision, fmeasure

*bar graph- algorithm * accuraccy
*bar graph- algorithm * precision
*bar graph- algorithm * recall
*bar graph- algorithm * fmeasure
